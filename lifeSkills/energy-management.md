## Question 6: Paraphrase the video - Brain Changing Benefits of Exercise. Minimum 5 points, only the points.
- Exercise immediately boosts mood and focus by increasing neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin. 
- A single workout can enhance attention and reaction time for a few hours post-exercise. 
- Over time, regular aerobic exercise enlarges and strengthens the Hippocampus — improving memory and long-term learning. 
- It also enhances the Prefrontal Cortex — improving focus, attention control, and decision-making. 
- Regular exercise helps build brain resilience, reducing risks of cognitive decline and diseases like Alzheimer's disease or dementia later in life. 
- For these benefits, doing at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 3–4 times a week is recommended.

## Question 7: What are some steps you can take to exercise more?
- Keep my clothes for exercise out before I go to bed, so I remember to exercise
