# Learning Process
## 1. What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.
Learning a concept in such depth that you could explain it to a 5-year-old in words they can understand.
## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
The idea that our brain needs to shift between two models - intense focus and relaxed thinking to really allow deeper understanding of a topic.
## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
- Active mode is when you concentrate completely - you are focused entirely on solving the problem before you
- Diffused mode is when you are not focusing all of your mental resources on the topic at hand, but rather, doing something else, like taking a walk.
## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
- Break down the skill
- Learn enough to self-correct
- Remove barriers to practice
- Practice something for at least 20 hours
## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
- Practicing a concept for 20 hours
- Making notes as I learn, so I can go back to them and make changes if necessary to my understanding of concepts.
