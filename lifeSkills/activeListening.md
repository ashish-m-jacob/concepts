# Listening and Active Communication
## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
- Be present and stay focused - Pay complete attention to the speaker and don't follow your own thought process while the speaker is speaking
- Make gestures that let the speaker know you are listening (nod when the speaker is speaking)
- Provide the speaker with verbal cues to let them know you are listening (saying hmm.. or "right")
- Allow the speaker to finish what they are saying before you speak. Resist the urge to interrupt the speaker
- Empathize with the speaker (Put yourself in their shoes to really understand their point of view)
- Recap what the speaker spoke about before you share your own thoughts

## 2. According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 
- Focusing completely on the conversation by trying to eliminate distractions while listening
- Seeing things from the speaker's perspective (empathy), encouraging the speaker to speak freely
- Reflect the speaker's mood and feelings, ensuring the speaker feels fully understood
- Give the speaker space by listening and allowing silence, instead of rushing to say something just to break the silence

## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?
- Distractions (I get distracted by the smallest change in my environment)
- My thoughts
- Relevance of the speaker's content to what I came to listen to

## 4. What can you do to improve your listening?
- I tend to struggle with showing empathy for the speaker, especially when our opinions do not match. I can work on listening to what the speaker says without focusing on my opinions on the matter.

 ## 5. When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?
 When I am in a situation with a lot of tension

 ## 6. When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?
 When someone challenges my ability in a conversation

 ## 7. When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?
When people don't get what I'm trying to say

## 8. How can you make your communication assertive? 
- Be clear in your mind about what you want to say before saying it out loud
- Use "I" statements
- Be respectful with your words
- Be open to hear the perspective of others
