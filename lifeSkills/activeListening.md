# Listening and Active Communication
## 1. What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
- Be present and stay focused - Pay complete attention to the speaker and don't follow your own thought process while the speaker is speaking
- Make gestures that let the speaker know you are listening (nod when the speaker is speaking)
- Provide the speaker with verbal cues to let them know you are listening (saying hmm.. or "right")
- Allow the speaker to finish what they are saying before you speak. Resist the urge to interrupt the speaker
- Empathize with the speaker (Put yourself in their shoes to really understand their point of view)
- Recap what the speaker spoke about before you share your own thoughts
