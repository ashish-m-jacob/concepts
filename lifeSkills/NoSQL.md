# NoSQL
- NoSQL (not only SQL) refers to a kind of database system that is non-relational - it does not store data in the form of tables like traditional databases. Data is stored as key-value pairs. This allows for the creation of flexible schemas (blueprints) upon which the database is built. 
- This kind of flexibility makes NoSQL the go-to system for applications involving content management, real-time analytics etc., 
- However, since NoSQL prioritizes speed and availability of data, it foregoes consistency. Furthermore, each database has its own syntax and its own set of API's which makes it more complex to work with.
